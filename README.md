# CodeViz - Interactive Codebase Visualizer

CodeViz is a full-stack developer tool that analyzes JavaScript/TypeScript codebases to generate a beautiful, interactive dependency graph. It helps developers visualize project architecture, understand the impact of changes, and identify potential structural issues like circular dependencies.



  ## üöÄ About The Project

As software projects grow, they become a tangled web of files importing other files. It becomes difficult to answer simple questions like: "If I change this file, what else might break?" or "Which files are the most critical hubs in our application?"

CodeViz solves this by transforming your codebase into an intuitive, explorable graph, making complex architectures easy to understand at a glance.

### Key Features

* **Interactive Dependency Graph:** Upload a `.zip` of your project and see all file connections visualized instantly. Drag, pan, and zoom to explore your code's structure.
* **Automatic Cycle Detection:** The backend uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to automatically find and highlight circular dependencies‚Äîa common source of bugs and architectural problems.
* **Insight Panel:** Click on any file in the graph to see a detailed breakdown of its `dependencies` (files it imports) and `dependents` (files that import it).
* **‚ú® AI-Powered Summaries (Planned Feature):** Get a plain-English summary of any file's purpose, generated by AI, so you can understand its role without reading the code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

This project is built with a modern full-stack architecture:

**Backend:**
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Babel Parser](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-parser) for Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generation
* [Multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) for file uploads
* [Unzipper](https://github.com/ZJONSSON/node-unzipper) for archive extraction

**Frontend:**
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) for graph visualization

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and `npm` installed on your machine.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/codeviz-project.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/codeviz-project.git)
    cd codeviz-project
    ```

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

You will need two separate terminals to run both the backend and frontend servers.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    * Navigate to the `/backend` directory.
    * Run the command:
        ```sh
        node server.js
        ```
    * The server will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Application:**
    * Navigate to the `/frontend` directory.
    * Run the command:
        ```sh
        npm start
        ```
    * Your browser will automatically open to `http://localhost:3000`.

## üîß How It Works

1.  The user uploads a `.zip` file via the React frontend.
2.  The Node.js backend receives the file, unzips it, and finds all relevant `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` files.
3.  For each file, **Babel Parser** creates an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**.
4.  The backend traverses the AST of each file to find all `import` statements, building a dependency map (an adjacency list).
5.  A **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm runs on this map to find and flag any nodes involved in a cycle.
6.  The final graph data (nodes and edges) is formatted into a JSON object and sent to the frontend.
7.  **React Flow** takes the JSON data and renders the beautiful, interactive graph in the browser.
